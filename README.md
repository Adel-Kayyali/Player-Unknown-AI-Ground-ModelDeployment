# **Player Unknown AI Ground**
## **Introduction**
This project is a machine learning model for predicting the winner of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), a popular online multiplayer battle royale game. The model is trained on a dataset of over 65,000 matches and uses a variety of features such as player rankings, in-game actions, and weather conditions to make its predictions.

The project includes a web application where users can input the relevant data for a match and get a prediction of the winning team. The application is built using the Streamlit framework and can be accessed [here](https://adel-kayyali-player-unknown-ai-ground-main-oe9xmu.streamlit.app/).

## **Usage**
It's a simple app, The predictions are based on data provided by the player, such as their kills, assists, and time survived.
